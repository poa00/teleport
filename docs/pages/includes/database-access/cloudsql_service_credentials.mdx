The Teleport Database Service must have credentials for the
`{{ serviceAccount }}` GCP service account.

If the Teleport Database Service is hosted on a VM, you can [change the
attached service
account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/change-service-account).

Alternatively, set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to
point to the JSON credentials file you downloaded earlier. For example, if you
use `systemd` to start `teleport`, then you should edit the service's
`EnvironmentFile` to include the env var:
```code
$ echo 'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json' | sudo tee -a /etc/default/teleport
```
