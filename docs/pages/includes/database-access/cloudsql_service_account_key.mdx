You can directly [attach the service account to a
VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/change-service-account).

Alternatively, go to that service account's Keys tab and create a new key:

![Service Account Keys](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-keys@2x.png)

Make sure to choose JSON format:

![Service Account New Key](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-new-key@2x.png)

Save the file. Your Teleport Database Service will need to use it as GCP
application credentials file.

<Admonition type="warning">
A service account key can be a security risk - we only describe using a key in
this guide for simplicity.
We do not recommend using service account keys in production.
If the Teleport Database Service is running on Google Cloud then the recommended
approach is to attach a service account to its Compute Engine instance.

See [authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#service-accounts)
in the Google Cloud documentation for more information about service account
authentication methods.
