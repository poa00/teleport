title: Day Two Operations
description: Provides instructions for completing common tasks on already running Teleport clusters
---

This section shows you how to perform common operations on already running
Teleport clusters. If you want to set up a new Teleport cluster, learn how to
[join Teleport agents to the
cluster](./protect-resources/join-services-to-your-cluster.mdx) and, if you are
self-hosting your cluster, [plan your
deployment](../reference//self-hosted.mdx).

## Regular tasks

- [Troubleshooting](./day-two-operations/troubleshooting.mdx): How to fix common
  Teleport issues.
- [Backup and Restore](./day-two-operations/backup-restore.mdx): Storing a
  copy of Auth Service backend data and restoring an Auth Service backend from
  the backup.
- [CA Rotation](./day-two-operations/ca-rotation.mdx): How to rotate the
  certificate authorities maintained by the Teleport Auth Service. To migrate to
  the split database CAs from clusters with only one database CA, read [Database
  CA Migration](./day-two-operations//db-ca-rotation.mdx).

## Migration guides

For self-hosted clusters, migrate your cluster to support newer Teleport
features that potentially require changes in your cluster setup:

- [Migrate to Proxy Peering](./day-two-operations/proxy-peering.mdx)
- [Migrate to TLS Routing](./day-two-operations/tls-routing.mdx)
