title: Self-Hosting Teleport
description: Provides guides to hosting your own Teleport cluster
---

If your organization has specific security needs that make it prohibitive to use
cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise, you can host the Teleport Auth Service and
Proxy Service on your own infrastructure. The guides in this section show you
how to self-host a Teleport cluster. 

For most organizations, we recommend using cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise. If
self-hosting Teleport is the only option, [contact the Teleport
team](https://goteleport.com/contact-us/) for help architecting your self-hosted
cluster.
