title: Running Teleport with a Key Management Service
description: Use your own key management service to sign certificates that Teleport uses to connect to infrastructure resources.

If you run a self-hosted Teleport cluster, you can configure technology managed
outside of Teleport to handle the private key material the Teleport Auth Service
uses to sign certificates. Read the following guides to set up Teleport with
your key management service or on-premise infrastructure:

- [AWS Key Management Service](./custom-cas/aws-kms.mdx)
- [Google Cloud Key Management Service](./custom-cas/gcp-kms.mdx)
- [Hardwdare Security Module](./custom-cas/hsm.mdx)
