title: Protect Infrastructure Resources with Teleport
description: Provides instructions for enrolling servers, Kubernetes clusters, databases, applications, and Windows desktops in your Teleport cluster.

Teleport makes it possible to manage access to a range of infrastructure
resources, from Kubernetes clusters to cloud provider APIs. The guides in this
section show you how to enroll infrastructure resources in your Teleport
cluster.

## Deploy Teleport agents

Teleport agents route traffic between the Teleport Proxy Service and resources
in your infrastructure, perform RBAC checks, and produce audit log messages.
Read the [Teleport Agents Overview](./protect-resources/agents.mdx) for a
description of how Teleport agents run in your cluster. 

Teleport makes a number of methods available for joining a Teleport agent to a
cluster. Read [Join Services to your
Cluster](./protect-resources/join-services-to-your-cluster.mdx) to find the most
appropraite method for your infrastructure. You can also read [Deploy Teleport
Agents with Terraform](./protect-resources/deploy-agents-terraform.mdx) for how
to manage a pool of agents using Infrastructure as Code.

Once you understand how you deploy Teleport agents, read the following guides
for running specific services on the agent in order to enroll infrastructure
resources with Teleport:

- [Applications](./protect-resources/application-access.mdx)
- [Databases](./protect-resources/database-access.mdx)
- [Kubernetes clusters](./protect-resources/kubernetes-access.mdx)
- [Servers](./protect-resources/server-access.mdx)
- [Windows desktops](./protect-resources/desktop-access.mdx)
